# Todo List Webapp

A modern, responsive todo list application built with React that stores data locally in the browser's localStorage.

## Features

- ✅ Add new todos
- ✅ Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- ✅ Edit existing todos (double-click to edit)
- ✅ Delete todos
- ✅ Date-based organization with 7-day view
- ✅ Progress tracking with visual progress bars
- ✅ Local storage persistence (data survives browser refresh)
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Modern, beautiful UI with smooth animations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## How It Works

- **Local Storage**: All todo data is automatically saved to the browser's localStorage and persists between sessions
- **Date Organization**: Todos are organized by creation date across 7 columns (Today, Tomorrow, and next 5 days)
- **Progress Tracking**: Each date column shows completion progress with visual progress bars
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected in the UI and saved to storage
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface with smooth animations and hover effects

## Usage

1. **Adding Todos**: Type in the input field and click "Add Todo" or press Enter
2. **Completing Todos**: Click the checkbox next to any todo to mark it as complete
3. **Editing Todos**: Double-click on any todo text to edit it inline
4. **Deleting Todos**: Click the trash icon to remove a todo
5. **Progress Tracking**: View your completion progress with the visual progress bars in each date column

## Data Storage

The app uses the browser's localStorage to persist your todos. This means:
- Your data is stored locally on your device
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No server or database required
- Data is private to your browser

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- CSS3 with modern features (flexbox, gradients, animations)
- localStorage for data persistence
- Responsive design principles
